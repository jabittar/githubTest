When from dark error's subjugation
My words of passionate exhortation
Had wrenched thy fainting spirit free
And writhing prone in thine affliction
Thou didst recall with malediction
The vice that had encompassed thee
And when thy slumbering conscience 
Fretting by recollection's torturing flame
Thou didst reveal the hideous secret
Of thy life's current ere I came
When suddenly I saw thee sicken
And weeping hide thine anguished face
Revolted, maddened, horror stricken
At memories of foul disgrace
